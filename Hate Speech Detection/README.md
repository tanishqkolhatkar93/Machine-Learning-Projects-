## Hate Speech Detection Using 1D CNN on GloVe embeddings

**Project Description :** Provided a sentence, the trained 1D CNN model trained with GloVe vectors will predict whether the sentence is offensive, hate speech, or neither.

The IPYNB file includes the code for the same and each cell processing has been explained as a comment before it to increase user understandability.

**Model training Parameters**:
<br><br>
Epochs = 10<br>
LR = 1e-5 (default value)<br>
Batch_size = 64<br>
Optimizer = Adam<br>
Loss Function = Categorical Cross Entropy Loss<br>
Metric = Accuracy<br>
