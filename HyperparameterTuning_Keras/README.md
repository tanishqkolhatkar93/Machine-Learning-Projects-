Hyperparameter tuning done on FashionMNIST dataset (Keras)
</p>

## 
The folder includes the notebook implementation for the CNN implementation on Fashion MNIST dataset.
The model performance is further improved using dropout,L2 regularisation and using Keras Autotuner.

##
The notebook includes explanation for the codes so it's easy to follow :)

## dataset:
FashionMNIST dataset
The dataset already exists as a part of the keras.datasets library and can be easily used.

Do check it out.
Cheers!
