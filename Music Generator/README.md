Music Generator

## About the Project
- Music Generator as the name suggests generates patterns of musical notes to create harmonious tunes.
- We achieve this by pattern detection and forward notes/pattern prediction to get a continuous output.
- In this project, we use a simple LSTM model for prediction.
