## MaskðŸ˜· vs No-MaskðŸ˜€ Detection using YOLOv5

### Setup

* Install Python3 from [here](https://www.python.org/)
* Open Windows Command Prompt.
* Clone the repository
```bash
  https://github.com/DSCVITBHOPAL/ML-Reserve.git
  ```
* Navigate inside the ```Mask-vs-No-Mask-Detection``` directory.
* Run this command
```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```
* If you want to test detection on your image then go to ```mask_detection.py``` file and just change the path in the ```image_path``` variable at ```line 15``` and add your own image's path in that field.
* Now we are good to go.

Run using Python:
```bash
  python mask_detection.py
  ```
Now you will see the Output with detections and bounding boxes in th ```Results``` folder.

To see how the Model was trained go to ```Model/Object_Detection.ipynb```
