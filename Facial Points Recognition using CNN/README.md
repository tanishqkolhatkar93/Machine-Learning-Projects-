# Facial Points Recognition Using Convolutional Neural Networks

The IPYNB file includes the code for the same and each cell processing has been explained as a comment before it to increase user understandability.

Due to large size of dataset, I have uploaded it on Google drive.

Link for the Dataset: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/14CfNI83kNAaceFbSNyov9Fm5VXFxmMF9?usp=sharing


**Project Description**: Provided an image of the face of a person, the trained 5 layered CNN model accurately predicts positions of certain features of the face such as left eye center, right eye center, left eyebrow center, right eyebrow center, nose tip, mouth left corner, mouth right corner, mouth center top lip, mouth center bottom lip and others.

**Model training Parameters**:
<br><br>
Epochs = 50<br>
LR = 1e-5 (default value)<br>
Batch_size = 256<br>
Optimizer = Adam<br>
Loss Function = Mean Squared Error Loss<br>
Metric = Mean Absolute Error<br>
<br>



Do check it out. Cheers!
