Nearly 28,000 near-Earth asteroids (NEAs) have been discovered by survey telescopes in close proximity to the Earth to date, with roughly 3,000 new discoveries every year. Over the next few years, as larger and more powerful survey telescopes come in the search, a substantial increase in findings is projected. Sometimes, these asteroids come very close to Earth’s future position and, because of small uncertainties in their positions, a future Earth impact cannot be completely ruled out. 

# Objective

Build a Machine Learning model that predicts whether or not an asteroid will be dangerous (or not!). 

# Data description

1.	‘Neo Reference ID’: This feature denotes the reference ID assigned to an asteroid.
2.	‘Name’: This feature denotes the name given to an asteroid.
3.   ‘Relative Velocity km per sec’: This feature denotes the relative velocity of the asteroid in kilometre per second.
7.	‘Relative Velocity km per hr’: This feature denotes the relative velocity of the asteroid in kilometre per hour.
8.	‘Orbiting Body’: This feature denotes the planet around which the asteroid is revolving.
