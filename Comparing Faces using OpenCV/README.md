In this project I have used OpenCV and face_recognition to compare two faces. This has been done in 3 steps. First, the images were loaded using the libraries. Then the face encodings were found for both the actual image and the test image(the image we are comparing the first face with). Finally the faces have been compared by comparing their encodings and the images are outputted. On the test image, we can see whether it is an image of the same person or not.
